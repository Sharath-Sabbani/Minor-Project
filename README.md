# Crop Price Prediction 




## Appendix

Crop price prediction is a complex task, but it is possible to use a variety of Machine learning algorithms to achieve good results. The best algorithm for a particular situation will depend on the specific data set and the desired accuracy.

We will be using historical data to train the prediction model.
The need for crop price prediction is helpful for risk management and decision making.


### Factors that affect crop prices:

- Weather: Weather conditions can have a significant impact on crop prices.
- Government policies: Government policies can also affect crop prices.
- Economic conditions: The overall economic conditions can also affect crop prices.

### Algorithms for crop price prediction:

- Linear regression: A simple but effective algorithm.
- Logistic regression: A more complex algorithm that can be used to predict crop prices that are categorical.
- Support vector machines: A powerful algorithm that can be used to predict crop prices.
- Neural networks: A complex algorithm that can be used to predict crop prices.



## Features
